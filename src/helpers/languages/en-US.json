My specialty is software development in which I like to be very detailed and self-taught every day. On the other hand, I am fascinated by the world of artificial intelligence and I have knowledge of Machine Learning. Currently I continue to train and learn new technologies. Because if I do not understand something I ask, if I do not know about the subject I investigate, but I always put all my commitment in what I do to offer quality projects.",
